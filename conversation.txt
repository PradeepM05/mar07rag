Human: what is self attention

AI: Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. It has been successfully used in various tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations. Self-attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when computing the output representation, making it a powerful tool for capturing dependencies within the sequence [4, 27, 28, 22].

In the context of neural networks, self-attention is a key component in models like the Transformer, where it helps reduce the distance between positions and enables the model to learn dependencies between distant positions more effectively compared to other architectures like ConvS2S and ByteNet. Self-attention layers are computationally efficient and can be parallelized, making them faster than recurrent layers in terms of computational complexity [12].

Overall, self-attention plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of neural network models by allowing them to capture long-range dependencies and relationships within a sequence efficiently and effectively.
